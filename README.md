# Personal-Projects
Small personal projects I've coded, both in Java and C++. 
Includes Scrabble calculator -- give it some letters and 
it will return the word containing those letters with the highest Scrabble score. 

Scrabble program works using ArrayLists and Strings. Will find the highest Scrabble score for any amount of characters, 
not just the standard 7 characters in a Scrabble game. Can also import your own dictionary file if you want to limit the word 
library the program utilizes.
